1. Introduction
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where a snake moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer. The objective is to survive as long as possible without colliding with itself or the screen boundaries.

2. Key Components of the Snake Game
Developing the Snake Game in C++ requires handling:

Game Loop: The continuous cycle of rendering, input handling, and logic updates.

Snake Movement: Controlling the snake’s direction based on user input.

Food Generation: Placing food at random positions.

Collision Detection: Checking for self-collisions and boundary collisions.

Scoring System: Keeping track of the player’s score.
